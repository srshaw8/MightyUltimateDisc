<span class="bigGD1">Introduction</span><br/>
Mighty Ultimate Disc takes privacy and data protection issues seriously. We are fully committed to respecting your privacy and to protecting any information that you provide to us. We have designed this Privacy Policy to explain how we handle personally identifiable information collected from participants who register with this site and submit information to Mighty Ultimate Disc through the Internet.
<br/><br/>
As the Mighty Ultimate Disc website evolves, we may revise this policy, so please check back frequently. If you have questions about Mighty Ultimate Disc's privacy practices please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mightyultimate.com">privacy@mightyultimate.com</a>.
<br/><br/>
Mighty Ultimate Disc is committed to safeguarding your privacy online. Our Privacy Policy is posted below to help you understand the care with which personal information is treated whenever you use our web site.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Scope of this Privacy Policy</span><br/>
This Privacy Policy covers Mighty Ultimate Disc's treatment of personally identifiable information collected from individuals  (hereafter "Registrant" or "Registrants") who use the Mighty Ultimate Disc website, as well as consumer information that we acquire in the course of our business.
<br/><br/>
This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies or websites that Mighty Ultimate Disc does not own or control, or to people that Mighty Ultimate Disc does not employ or manage.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Personal Information Collected</span><br/>
For any one event, Registrants can assume one of three roles with varying degrees authority. These roles are organizer, captain and player.  Depending on the role, a Registrant can view varying levels of personal information associated with other Registrants who have registered for a particular event. The personal information we collect on the site includes first and last name, mailing address, email address, and contact phone number(s).  The information collected will not be shared with any other party except in the cases outlined below.
<br/><br/>
A Registrant who creates and manages an ultimate frisbee event is considered to be an organizer. The Mighty Ultimate Disc website collects information about Registrants on behalf of organizers in which a Registrant is participating.  Mighty Ultimate Disc acts as an agent in collecting information from the Registrant for the organizer and produces several reports for the organizer about Registrants in order to manage the event. In case an organizer needs to contact a Registrant, they are allowed to view the phone and emergency contact information for any Registrant who has registered for their event. Organizers also have the ability to send email to any team whose members have indicated through their account settings that it's acceptable to receive email from a captain or organizer. By virtue of sending the email, the email addresses of participating team members plus the organizer's email address will be visible to all in the email address line. Organizers can also view a Registrant's ultimate skill self rating in order to conduct a draft of players onto teams. Additionally, organizers can view the email address and the home and cell phone numbers of any Registrant on the wait list so as to facilitate the placement process of moving a Registrant from the wait list to the active roster. Finally, for UPA sanctioned events, organizers will be able to view any Registrant's home address, home phone number and email address as part of a report submitted to the UPA for sanctioning purposes.
<br/><br/>
Captains are designated by the organizer once they've registered for the organizer's event. Captains can view ultimate skill related profile data for drafting purposes and a Registrant's home phone number in case they need to contact them. Captains can also send an email message to those team members who have indicated through their account settings that it's acceptable for the captain to send emails to them. By virtue of sending the email, team member email addresses plus the captain's will be visible to all in the email address line.
<br/><br/>
Players are Registrants who have not been designated as a captain or organizer for a particular event.  Players can not view personal or profile information of other Registrants. They can, however, see other Registrants' email address if 1) a captain or organizer sends a team email message and 2) the other Registrants on the team have indicated through their account settings that it's acceptable to receive emails from the captain or organizer.
<br/><br/>
At any time, Registrants can update their personal information by logging into their Mighty Ultimate Disc account and clicking on the "Player Profile" link.  They may also update their account settings by clicking on the "Account Settings" link.
<br/><br/>
Registrant information is protected by a password that the Registrant chooses.  Registrants should assure that the password selection is not obvious, should change the password periodically, and should not disclose the password to unauthorized people.  Mighty Ultimate Disc has designed the MightyUltimate.com website to include reasonable, industry accepted security measures to protect your information.  However, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be guaranteed secure in all instances.  Therefore, Mighty Ultimate Disc accepts no liability for disclosure of Registrant profile information caused transmission errors or the acts or omissions of third parties.
<br/><br/>
By registering with Mighty Ultimate Disc, Registrants grant Mighty Ultimate Disc the right to use your information in an aggregate form without any personal identifiers.
<br/><br/>
If a Registrant's account is cancelled or terminated, Mighty Ultimate Disc may delete Registrant's account and profile information from the Mighty Ultimate Disc database.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Cookies</span><br/>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Generally, cookies work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of our site. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information; we use them for a variety of purposes including the ability to personalize your website visit, to save your player profile data and to keep track of what events you have signed up for. Additionally, after you've entered your player ID and password during a session on our website, we save that information so you don't have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Mighty Ultimate Disc website unavailable to you.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">IP Address</span><br/>
Mighty Ultimate Disc receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, your browser brand and version, and the page you request.  This information may be used to administer our website and to assist in diagnosing problems with our server.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Payments</span><br/>
Registrants who opt to pay online any event setup fees to Mighty Ultimate Disc or event fees due to an organizer for an event in which they will participate do so through a third party vendor, Paypal.  Payment is initiated from a secure web page, using SSL encryption, on the Mighty Ultimate Disc website and completed from within Paypal's website.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Email Notifications</span><br/>
E-mailing Registrants is a vital component of the Mighty Ultimate Disc system as it is the primary method by which organizers, captains and Mighty Ultimate Disc communicate with Registrants. Therefore, Registrants can expect to receive e-mails under the following circumstances when they:
<ul>
<li>create an account</li>
<li>request a new password</li>
<li>request their account ID</li>
<li>register for an event</li>
<li>add themselves to an event's wait list</li>
<li>are removed from an event's wait list by the organizer</li>
<li>opt to receive event related email from the captain or organizer</li>
<li>opt to receive unsolicited email from Mighty Ultimate Disc</li>
</ul>
<span class="bigGD1">Testimonials</span><br/>
We may post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the Registrant's name.  We do obtain the Registrant's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Business Transitions</span><br/>
If Mighty Ultimate Disc is acquired by another company or sells all or a portion of its assets to another company, or in the event of a merger, it is likely that user information will be a part of the assets transferred. If as a result of such a business transition information is to be collected, used or disclosed in a manner or for a purpose different from that stated above, Mighty Ultimate Disc will endeavour to notify all users of such changes beforehand.
<br/><br/>
<span class="bigGD1">Legal Disclaimer</span><br/>
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.
<br/><br/>

Mighty Ultimate Disc reserves the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Mighty Ultimate Disc will use personally identifiable information, Mighty Ultimate Disc will post a prominent notice on the Mighty Ultimate Disc homepage at www.MightyUltimate.com prior to implementing the change. The amended Terms shall automatically become effective immediately after they are posted. Your continued use of the site or the Mighty Ultimate Disc website after the posting of the amended Terms on the website constitutes your affirmative: (a) acknowledgement of the terms and its modifications; and (b) agreement to abide and be bound by the terms, as amended.
